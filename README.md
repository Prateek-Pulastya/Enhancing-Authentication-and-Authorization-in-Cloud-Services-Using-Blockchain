Master's Thesis
Here is a detailed summary of my MSc research thesis titled:

---

## **Title:**

**Blockchain-Based Identity and Authentication for Cloud Services**

---

## **Summary**

### **1. Objective**

The research investigates how blockchain technology, specifically **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)** frameworks, can enhance **authentication and identity management** in cloud computing environments. The goal is to overcome challenges like centralization, data breaches, and lack of user control in traditional cloud authentication systems.

---

### **2. Background and Motivation**

Traditional identity systems (like OAuth, SAML, OpenID) rely on centralized authorities, making them vulnerable to:

* Single points of failure
* Data leaks
* Identity theft

The COVID-19 pandemic and rise of remote work have further highlighted the need for **decentralized, secure, and privacy-preserving** identity solutions.

---

### **3. Proposed Solution**

The project proposes using a **blockchain-based SSI model** built on **Hyperledger Indy** and **Aries**. This allows users to:

* Control their own identity credentials
* Authenticate to cloud services securely without revealing excessive personal data
* Avoid dependence on third-party identity providers

---

### **4. Technologies Used**

* **Hyperledger Indy**: A blockchain for decentralized identity
* **Hyperledger Aries**: Middleware for issuing/verifying credentials
* **Trinsic**: API-based platform for SSI management
* **DIDComm**: Communication protocol between digital wallets
* **AnonCreds**: Privacy-preserving verifiable credentials
* **Python, Docker, Postman**: Tools used for implementation and testing

---

### **5. System Architecture**

The system involves three main actors:

* **Issuer** (e.g., university or company): Issues verifiable credentials
* **Holder** (user): Stores credentials in a digital wallet
* **Verifier** (cloud service): Requests proof for authentication

Workflow:

1. Issuer issues credentials via DID and Indy ledger
2. Holder stores credentials in Trinsic wallet
3. Verifier sends proof request â†’ holder presents verifiable proof
4. Authentication completed based on cryptographic trust

---

### **6. Results and Evaluation**

* The prototype system was successfully implemented.
* Real-time issuance and verification of credentials worked.
* SSI showed improved user control, reduced identity theft risks, and removed the need for centralized authentication systems.

**Strengths Identified:**

* Better privacy and data minimization
* Reduced risk of phishing
* Transparent and auditable identity flows

---

### **7. Limitations**

* Performance testing was minimal.
* Integration with existing cloud platforms (like AWS, Azure) remains to be fully developed.
* Usability for non-technical users could be improved.

---

### **8. Conclusion**

The research demonstrates that SSI on blockchain is a **viable alternative to centralized identity** in the cloud. It improves security, privacy, and control while reducing reliance on intermediaries. It lays the groundwork for further exploration of scalable, interoperable identity systems using blockchain for real-world cloud ecosystems.

### **9. Future Work**

* Integration with mainstream cloud services (e.g., AWS IAM)
* Improved performance benchmarking
* Incorporation of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced privacy
* Development of user-friendly digital wallet interfaces
* Study of regulatory and compliance implications (e.g., GDPR)
